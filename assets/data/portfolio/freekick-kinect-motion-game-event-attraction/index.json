KoçFest travels between universities across Turkey to reach talented students. Holding’s companies host stands in the festival. They also commission installations to attract students to hire. Home electronics manufacturer Vestel commissioned this motion sensor game for their stand. Vestel had been sponsoring football organizations for a long time. Hence, a football themed kickoff game was proposed for them.</p>\n<p>I have programmed the game as a contractor from Yeti Interactive. Our client was Work&#x26;Work, a digital event agency who came up with the idea. The game uses Kinect camera to detect direction of a kick. This is used to animate ball on a big screen. In addition, a virtual ball on a screen placed under their feed provided extra feedback for players. Players will shoot 3 times. Furthermore, they gain score based on the difficulty of the shot. Afterwards, the highest scoring players received awards based on a daily leaderboard.</p>\n","tags":[{"title":"Flash"},{"title":"Event"}]}},"context":{}}
