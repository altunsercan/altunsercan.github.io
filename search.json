[{"title":"Understanding Artificial Intelligence In Games","path":"/blog/understanding-artificial-intelligence-games/","summary":"Artificial Intelligence is a broad field on its own. As you start to work on an AI project it gets highly technical and specialized very quickly. That is why there are many AI applications using variety of algorithms to solve problems. Through my experience I found out that problem dictates the algorithm heavily. As such while most of the algorithms fall into one category or another their approaches are often so distinct that learning one type of AI does not necessarily train you in another."}]
