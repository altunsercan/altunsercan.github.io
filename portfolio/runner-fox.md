Sillywalk Games wanted to produce a runner title for a hyper casual mobile game market. Runner Fox is an endless running game, in which challenges playerâ€™s reflexes with accelerating difficulty.

I worked with Sillywalk Games as a freelancer before in reproduction of Mind Mould 2. Stars were aligned when I moved to Canada, the studio had already been relocated to Canada. This time I worked there as full-time employee to develop Runner Fox. I developped the game fully within a month along with its ad-network and analytics integration. This was the first project I implemented an ad mediation waterfall to optimize ad revenue.
